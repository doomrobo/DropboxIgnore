##Dropbox Ignore##

A perl script that allows you to use perl regex to omit certain files from your dropbox. For now, you need three things to use this:
0. A local store of data that you will be linking to Dropbox
0. An empty Dropbox folder
0. Perl

Once you have the three, simply run the script like so:

	perl dropboxignore.pl <path/to/local/store> <path/to/Dropbox>

And let the magic do it's work.
To stop, you must type in

	kill <pid>

Where &lt;pid&gt; is the number from the line "Child is &lt;number&gt;" that printed when you ran the command to start the script. There will be a script to do this for you in the future.

Note: This is by no means magic, nor does it work as such. For clear proof of this fact, plase refer to the TODO.mkd.
